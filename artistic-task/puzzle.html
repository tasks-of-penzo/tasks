    <h1>The Artistic Task</h1>
    <p class="flavour">
        Paint a picture of your choosing. Your time starts now.

    <div class="puzzle">
        <div class="attempts">
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                First I thought I would try painting a piece of formalwear, 
                but I was worried that I would accidentally paint a rowing enthusiast instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Then I contemplated painting someone with children, 
                but I didn't want to unwittingly paint something conferring intellectual property rights instead. 
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Next I considered painting a quadratic curve, 
                but I thought I might end up painting a distrustful person instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                After that, I thought about painting a particular pronic number, 
                but I was anxious about the possibility of painting a subtle detail instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Then I had the idea of painting somewhere for flowers to grow, 
                but I was scared of unintentionally painting Metapod's favourite move instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Next I wanted to paint a famous civil engineer, 
                but I really didn't want to mistakenly paint a country instead. 
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Afterwards, I had the thought to paint a French river, 
                but I was concerned about painting part of a book instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Then I was going to paint a workers' protest, 
                but I thought there was a chance I would paint a hook-billed bird instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Next I tried painting a Portuguese estate, 
                but I was nervous about painting a trendy superfood instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                After that, I had a go at painting a snooker player's action, 
                but I couldn't take the risk of painting Max Park's hobby instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Then I thought I could paint a herb, 
                but I couldn't shake the idea that I might paint a textile pattern instead.
            </div>
            <div class="attempt">
                <div class="bullet"></div>
                Finally, I pondered the idea of painting something that might contain treasure, 
                but I was too scared of painting someone who had obtained a dishonest advantage instead.
            </div>
            <div class="conclusion">
                In the end, I didn't paint anything at all &#128532;
            </div>
        </div>
